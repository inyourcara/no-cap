      <h1>More About the Brand</h1>
      <p>Essentially, Teva® has two fundamental responsibilities: to play and to protect. We play in the water, but we also see the need to be protected from it. Our responsibility is to manage this delicate balance, so you can go forth without reservation. Armed with 30 years worth of knowledge and technology, we are dedicated to developing products that strike this balance to deliver the most out of your adventures.</p>

      <h1>Teva Info</h1>
      <p>In 1984, a young Grand Canyon river guide revolutionized the footwear industry when he created the world's first sport sandal. This idea soon spawned a brand, and the Teva® adventure was born.<br /><br />It's been 30 years since we took our first step in the Grand Canyon, and not a moment has gone by that Teva® (that's "teh'-vah," not "tee-vah") hasn't been hard at work developing products that enable and encourage your adventure. Given our heritage, we have an obsession with water, and our passion lies in identifying and enhancing the ways that water affects an adventure. Water presents a paradox. It is the source of a year-round playground, but it simultaneously poses a year-round problem. Anyone who has ever slipped on a patch of ice or had to walk in soaking wet socks can attest to this duality.</p>
